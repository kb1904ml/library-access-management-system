# Library-Automation
This project aims to streamline the process of library entry and exit by implementing barcode scanning technology. It involves the development of a system that automates the check-in and check-out process for library users. Additionally, a website is created to allow users to check the current availability of the library.

The system utilizes barcode scanning, where users are provided with unique barcode IDs that can be scanned upon entry and exit. This allows for quick and efficient tracking of library attendance. The system maintains a real-time record of the number of people inside the library at any given time.

For library administrators, the system provides additional features. Admins can access a list of people currently present in the library, which helps in managing the library space and ensuring compliance with occupancy limits. Moreover, admins have the ability to generate reports by downloading entry records of individuals who entered the library within a specified time frame.

Overall, this project aims to enhance the library experience by automating the entry process, providing real-time occupancy information, and offering convenient record-keeping features for administrators.
